The [TAMU Physics Lab Center](https://plc.tamu.edu/) is responsible for setting up labs used in the physics ciriculum, building physics demonstrations, and for delivering physics demonstrations to physics
professors. We currently have a website with all the physics demonstrations that can be ordered, but the current issue with the PLC website is that unless you already have a 
good understanding of what demonstrations we have in our storeroom there are a lot of demos that never get ordered because the categorization of demonstrations on our website is 
very broad. In order to help professors find the best demonstration for their lecture I am developing a CrewAI-powered multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end process of 
finding the perfect demonstrations for a lecture and ordering a lecture based on a professor's syllabus. The diagram below explains the ideal flow of the final working system.

This project is currently very WIP, I'd ideally like to turn this into a streamlit application with a mock UI fed with real class syllabi before pitching 
this to my boss as something to implement on our live website.
